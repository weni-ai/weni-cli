# CEP Agent Example :material-map-marker:

This example shows how to create an agent that can provide address information based on Brazilian postal codes (CEP).

## Agent Definition

Create a file named `agents.yaml`:

```yaml
agents:
  sample_agent:
    name: "CEP Agent"
    description: "Weni's CEP agent"
    instructions:
      - "You are an expert in providing addresses to the user based on a postal code provided by the user"
      - "The user will send a ZIP code (postal code) and you must provide the address corresponding to this code."
    guardrails:
      - "Don't talk about politics, religion or any other sensitive topic. Keep it neutral."
    skills:
      - get_address:
          name: "Get Address"
          source: 
            path: "skills/get_address"
            entrypoint: "main.GetAddress"
          description: "Function to get the address from the postal code"
          parameters:
            - cep:
                description: "postal code of a place"
                type: "string"
                required: true
                contact_field: true
```

## Skill Implementation

Create a file `skills/get_address/main.py`:

```python
from weni import Skill
from weni.context import Context
from weni.responses import TextResponse
import requests


class GetAddress(Skill):
    def execute(self, context: Context) -> TextResponse:
        cep = context.parameters.get("cep", "")
        address_response = self.get_address_by_cep(cep=cep)
        return TextResponse(data=address_response)

    def get_address_by_cep(self, cep):
        url = f"https://viacep.com.br/ws/{cep}/json/"
        response = requests.get(url)
        return response.json()
```

Create a file `skills/get_address/requirements.txt`:

```
requests==2.31.0
```

## Deployment Steps

1. Deploy the agent:
   ```bash
   weni project push agents.yaml
   ```

## Testing

After deployment, you can test the agent by:

1. Opening your project in the Weni platform
2. Finding the CEP Agent in your agents list
3. Starting a conversation
4. Sending a valid Brazilian postal code (e.g., "01311-000")
